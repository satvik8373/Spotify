# Favicon Fix for Vercel Deployment

This README provides instructions to fix the "There was an issue rendering your favicon" error on Vercel deployments.

## Quick Fix

1. You already have `favicon.svg` and `favicon.png` in the public directory
2. Convert the PNG to ICO format using one of these online converters:
   - [ConvertICO.com](https://convertico.com/)
   - [ICOConvert.com](https://icoconvert.com/)
   - [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)

3. Upload the `favicon.png` file and download the resulting `favicon.ico`
4. Place the `favicon.ico` file in the public directory
5. No need to change the `index.html` file as it already has the correct references

## Verifying the Fix

After following these steps and deploying to Vercel, the favicon issue should be resolved. The browser will use:

1. `favicon.svg` on modern browsers that support SVG favicons
2. `favicon.ico` on older browsers or environments that don't support SVG favicons
3. `apple-icon-180.png` on iOS devices as the Apple touch icon

## Additional Resources

If you need a more comprehensive favicon set for better cross-platform support, use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) with your SVG file as the source.
